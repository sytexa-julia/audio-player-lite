# XAPL: XAPL Audio Player Lite

A really simple and lightweight mp3 / ogg player for Windows.

## Status

This project is archived. I found this backup recently and figured I'd put it on Github. The executable works find in Windows 11 but
it would take some work to configure it to build from source with current tooling.

At one point it was working in Linux and Mac OS X as well, but I don't believe this is the latest source code.

### Building

You will need at least wxWidgets and a Visual C++ compiler.
